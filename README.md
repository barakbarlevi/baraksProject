using an open source simulation called CADAC to produce ballistic trajectories. Wrote own code to run them in real time and plot on Google Earth.

Primary_Controller.kml needs to be dragged into Google Earth.

Demo.png shows overlapping trajectories hapenning.

Please execuse the massive amount of globals, comments, and diorder. It's still in writing.
